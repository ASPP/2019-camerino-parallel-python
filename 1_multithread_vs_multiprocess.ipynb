    "1. Modify the `func` function in `1_problem.py` so that it takes approximately 1 second to execute. (You choose what it does.)\n",
    "1. Load it into this notebook using the cell below that has the `%load` magic.\n",
    "1. Use the cell with the `%%time` magic to see how long it takes 4 instances of the `func` function to execute with 1) a single thread, 2) multiple threads and 3) multiple processes.\n",
