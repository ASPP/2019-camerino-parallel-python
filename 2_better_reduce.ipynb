    "# Exercise 2. Build a better reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you will use `dask.delayed` and `dask.visualize` to investigate the task graph for Python's built-in `reduce` function. You will then make your own `reduce` function with logic that is (hopefully) more parallelizable. Lastly, you'll compare the parallel execution times of your reduce function with the built-in reduce to see if it worked. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reduce function, located in the built-in `functools` package, applies a function to a list to produce a single output. The function must take two inputs, and it is successively applied to pairs in the input list until the final output is reached. For example, if you want to apply an `add` function to a list of integers, reduce will first apply `add` to the first two elements of the list. It will then apply `add` to that result and the third element in the list. It will then apply `add` to that result and the fourth element in the list. And so on.\n",
